A repository filled with all my codewars challenge triumphs and failures along with impactful code that I learned from.

Every morning I wake up and work on a Codewar!

## Optimizations

I consistently refactor and optimize my code, sometimes for efficiency, sometimes for readability.


## Lessons Learned:

My main take away from doing daily codeWars is that there is always more than one way to solve a problem. You may not always arrive at the answer on your own but it's extremely important to take away and learn from your failure so you can recognize similar problems in the future and know how to go about answering it.
