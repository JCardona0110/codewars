// It is easy to join two strings together like this string1 + string2.

// Another way to get the desired result would be with string1.concat(string2)

// ES6 has introduced another way of joining strings. Your task is to find out what this is and write a function that will add two strings together, there must be a space between the two strings.

// + , .concat() & .join() will not be allowed in this exercise. I have also removed some other methods that can be used to cheat!

// If one of the arguments is a number your code must coerce it into being a string.

// p-2 strings
// r-return
// string1 = 'hi welcome'
// string2 = 'my webapp'
// combine to read 'hi welcome to my webapp'
const joinStrings = (string1, string2) => `${string1} ${string2}`;
//take in 2 strings
// combine and return
